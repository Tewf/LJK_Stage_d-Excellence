## 🎯 Project Topic

**Decomposition of Bilinear Tensors**  
The main objective was to study and implement techniques for generating alternative bases using sparse decompositions for matrix multiplication, as well as minimizing the rank of bilinear tensors through specific automorphisms, with applications to polynomial multiplication.

- Application of developed methods to matrix and polynomial multiplication.

## 🧠 Skills Developed

- Tensor rank and decomposition
- Linear, bilinear, and polynomial algebra
- Efficient algorithms & fast arithmetic
- Complexity theory
- Development in Python and Julia
- Scientific writing and presentation

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 `Bilinear Rank Over Finite Field`

This part of the project focuses on reducing the rank of bilinear maps over finite fields.  
Given a bilinear map, the code returns another bilinear map that spans the same space but has a lower rank.

### 🔹 `Sparsifying Matrices`

This component provides code for sparsifying matrices.  
Given a matrix, it produces a sparser version while preserving key structural properties.

## 📄 Mathematical Background

Each subproject includes a detailed PDF document explaining the mathematical theory behind the implementations.  
We recommend downloading and reading the PDFs instead of relying on the README, as LaTeX offers a clearer format for expressing mathematical notation and concepts.
