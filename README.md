# Internship Project: Alternative Bases for Bilinear Tensor Decomposition

This GitHub repository contains the code developed during the internship titled:

**_Bases alternatives pour la décomposition de tenseurs bilinéaires associés au produit de matrices (H/F)_**  
Conducted from **May 21, 2024 to July 15, 2024**.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 `Bilinear Rank Over Finite Field`

This part of the project focuses on reducing the rank of bilinear maps over finite fields.  
Given a bilinear map, the code returns another bilinear map that spans the same space but has a lower rank.

### 🔹 `Sparsifying Matrices`

This component provides code for sparsifying matrices.  
Given a matrix, it produces a sparser version while preserving key structural properties.

## 📄 Mathematical Background

Each subproject includes a detailed PDF document explaining the mathematical theory behind the implementations.  
We recommend downloading and reading the PDFs instead of relying on the README, as LaTeX offers a clearer format for expressing mathematical notation and concepts.
